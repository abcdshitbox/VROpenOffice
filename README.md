# VROpenOffice

## Description:
An extended and feature-rich version of VRDesktop(http://www.vrdesktop.net/). Imagine VRDesktop with multiple screens, an open world environment and the ability to use leap motion to control objects. 

## Arch :
This is built in UE4.8 and is a fully open source project. The only part of this project that isn't open source is CoherantUI and is required to build out the screens/UI/HUD. You can get this from their website and requesting a trial if you want to expound on what I have built.
